# jokenpo
This game is similiar to the known rock-paper-scissors game, here in Brazil, we call joquemp√¥ or jokenpo. 
The first version was published in 2022, and now after almost 3 years, I decided to refactor the code, it drives me to my beginning at programming, and showed me how bad my code was.
For this version, I put into practice some new concepts I learned, starting with object-oriented programming, and its good practices, such as inversion and dependency injection.
